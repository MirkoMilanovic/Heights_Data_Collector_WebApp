<!--
The homepage is usually called index.html. The structure of the html "head" is similar, and in "body", it is good to
put everything in 1 div which contains everything. We put some text...
We need to create:
1 FORM = 2 INPUT + 1 BUTTON
The method of the form can be:
    - GET (normally, you call file from the server, you just need the data)
    - POST (when you send the data to the server)
<input title="xx" placeholder="xx" type="xx", min="x" max="x" step="x"name="xx" required>
            - title is shown when the cursor is over the input,
            - placeholder is the default text shown,
            - type that is only allowed to enter
            - min, max, step - for numbers to tell the range and step (1 is by default)
            - name is used for python (give me the value for the input where name=email_name)
            - required is written if it is required entry
<button type="submit"> Submit </button>
            - inside the tag goes the name of the button
            - type can be submit (to submit all form), reset (to reset the whole form)

We check if the form and pages are working well... create a virtual env..... create a flask....
After making Flask, you should try
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<title> Data Collector App</title>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Web Data Collector</title>
    <link href="../static/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Collecing heights</h1>
        <h3>Please fill the entries to get population statistics on heights</h3>
        <div class="message">
            {{text | safe}}
        </div>
        <form action="{{url_for('success')}}" method="POST">      <!--making a form, it activates other page, method is post-->
            <input title="Your email will be safe with us" placeholder="Enter your email address" type="email" name="email_name" required><br>
            <input title="Your data will be safe with us" placeholder="Enter your height in cm" type="number" min="50" max="300" step="0.1" name="height_name" required><br>
            <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
        </form>
    </div>
</html>
